<h1>Matthew Bowker, <i>Lead PI</i></h1>
<p><i>Northern Arizona University</i>
<p><b>Background:</b> Matt Bowker is a community ecologist and restoration ecologist. He has focused on soil biota in dryland ecosystems throughout his career and readily admits an inordinate fondness for biocrusts since his  first research project as an undergraduate. He is actively involved in development of methodologies to restore biocrusts to degraded ecosystems, drawing lessons from community ecology related to community assembly processes, alternate state and resilience concepts, and species interactions. He also views biocrusts as a useful model system to learn about ecological communities, and sees great potential in coordinated research to help biocrust research make the jump from parochial to global. 
<p><b>Project roles:</b> Coordinate the network, oversee sample processing and data management at NAU

<h1>Anita Antoninka, <i>co-PI</i></h1>
<p><i>Northern Arizona University</i>
<p><b>Background:</b>  Anita Antoninka is an ecologist with emphasis on soils, interactions with primary producers, restoration and community interactions. A major research area is in the use of soil organisms, including biocrust, in restoration of degraded ecosystems. She has been involved in biocrust restoration research for the last 10 years, developing methods to cultivate, reinoculated and scale up efforts, with a focus on climate resilience.

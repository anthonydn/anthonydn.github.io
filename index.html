<p>CrustNet is a globally distributed sampling network dedicating to understanding the ecology of biological soil crusts (biocrusts). This project implements a standard set of surveys and experiments in diverse biocrust habitats. These surveys and experiments were selected and collaboratively designed by biocrust scientists.</p>

<p>Our work is aimed at understanding:</p>
  <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
    <li>Determinants of global scale functional biodiversity of biocrusts</li>
    <li>Determinants of the variability and shape of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function across ecosystems</li>
    <li>Effects of biocrust functional biodiversity on ecosystem resistance and resilience to physical disturbance and climate change</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We connect with scientists around the world to install CrustNet nodes on the ground. Our project takes a tiered approach with basic and low costs surveys making up the base of the project (Tier 1) and then additional add-on experiments with increasing levels of commitment and investment for Tiers 2 & 3.  Collaborators who are familiar with the biocrust and plant species of each node are invaluable to the work. But also offer support for species identification through our network of biocrust scientists and crowd-sourcing tools like iNaturalist. </p>

      </tr>

  <p>Through this work, we hope to inspire scientific and social engagement with biocrust ecology, to answer our scientific questions and stimulate many more, to produce usable tools for future biocrust work including a trait database, and to grow & strengthen the international biocrust network. </p>
